# MoreFontSizes

A simple mod for Wrath of the Righteous that changes the Font Size slider in the options menu to a much larger range. 

The original slider allowed values from 0.8 to 1.2, this mod allows ranges from 0.1 to 5. Note that not all text in the games is adjusted by this slider, and that both extremes will make the UI hard to use.

## Installation

1. Ensure [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager) is installed correctly, and set up to point to Wrath of the Righteous (Pathfinder Second Adventure in the menu).
2. Download the zip file from the releases page.
3. Drag the zip file into UMM in the mods tab.
